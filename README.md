## What is AncapHub?

AncapHub is a community-driven effort to build a platform focused on connecting libertarians, providing an environment that while directed to studies, provides full-fledged social experience.

## We're completely open source

We believe that everyone should be able to have access to education and information.
With that said, we decided to leave the source code open for everyone to read,
contribute and also copy, without restrictions.
